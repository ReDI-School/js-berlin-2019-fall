# More project mindset

* holistic project from the first day
* long-term project
* little projects from the beginning to end
* start final project earlier
* how to plan and split tasks/project into smaller steps (especially become problem during the final project, did not know what to work on after creating a sketch)

# More practise

* exercise
* more homework (maybe smaller exercise on Tue)

# More teamwork

* teamwork
* more activities as a group

# More diverse content

* mind map of web development (TypeScript, differences between different versions of JS)
* real life code blocks, functions, small exercises on that (always give the why before teaching something, how are we going to use this information you are about to teach, i.e. creating search button, calling functions inside others, where do we use arrays, etc.)
* programming with functions
* advanced functions (function calling another one)
* more dom (how to accomplish different effects using dom, popups)
* debugging
* do not ignore unused or old methods, knowing more never killed anyone
* less recaps of theory

# Improve the psychology of the students

* keep encouraging students to ask “stupid” question in the middle and at the end of the course
* unengaged teaching assistants in the beginning
* more chocolate
* chocolate
* more hugs
