# The Good

* Nice teachers, available and willing to help, online and offline.
* Good time management.
* Recap every lesson, actually asking the students what they remember from the last time.
* Slides are well structured.
* (now) more exercises for advanced students.

# The Bad

* Pace:
  * at the beginning it was very undecided, split between too slow and too fast.
  * now the people who thought it was slow think it is okay, but the students who thought it was too fast still think its too fast.
* Noise from other classes.
* the break wastes more than 10 minutes of time.
* some students think 2 hours is not enough.


# The Ugly

* We should make the homework somehow mandatory for students to give them an incentive to solve it and learn
  * one of the students (chosen randomly) should present their solutions every lesson.
  * we should give a head start on the homework at the end of every lesson.
* Try working in pairs.
* We could be at school half an hour early and help students with any problems they have.
